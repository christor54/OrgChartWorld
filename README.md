# Org Chart Visualization

Visualize the hierarchy of an organization with relevant insightful data. Org charts let organizations quickly and easily visualize their workforce in real time, helping executives make informed decisions about hiring, performance and accountability, allowing employees to find and collaborate with coworkers, and providing the framework for communicating operational information and managing change.

In addition to being used to visualize workforce hierarchies, org charts can also be used to visualize other hierarchies, such as family trees.
